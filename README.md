# VAir Project

The VAir project develops a platform for the monitoring of viral particles in the atmosphere. Here, we extract the values from the sensor to analyze the data, calculate the quality factor of the system, observe the stability of the system, plot the graphs to observe details, and also calculate the sensitivity of the system.
