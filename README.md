# Sensor frequency analysis

### The VAir projects developes a plartform for the monitoring of viral particles in the atmosphere. 

### Here, we extract the values from the sensor to analyse the data, calculate the quality factor of the system, observe the stability of the system, plot the graphs to observe details and also to calculate the sensitivity of the system."
